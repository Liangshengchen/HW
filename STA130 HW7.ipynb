    "For example, in a simple linear regression y = mx + b, the data may in fact have a quadratic relationship such as y = mx^2 +b, that is increasing upward. But, since we are trying to do a linear fit on the data, it clearly doesn't explain the variability in the data, in the sense that when x is large and increases, y increases much more than linear model predicts due to the quadratic. However, the overall trend of the quadratic data points are still upwards, meaning the line of best fit we draw, would definitely be upward with the slope being positive. This fitted slope would have p value much smaller than 0.05, since there is indeed an upward trend, so there is definitely an effect of increasing x causing y to increase, which gives the statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this multi-dimensional fit, while we find that there are 5 independent variables that have values larger than 10, with p values much smaller than 0.05, this only says the general trend is upward: as these 5 independent variables increase, it is \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the value y would increase, this is what p value less than 0.05 means. However, the actual data y may depend on these 5 independent variables in much more complicated ways than simple linear. Hence, this gives a small R^2.\n",
