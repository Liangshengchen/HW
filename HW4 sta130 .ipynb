The interval is calculated by adding and subtracting 2 times the SEM (an approximation for the critical value) from the sample mean. However, this method requires knowing the SEM, which depends on the sample's standard deviation and size.\n",

For example, the left endpoint of the interval can be chosen to be the 3rd smallest sample mean, and the right endpoint of the interval can be chosen to be the 3rd largest sample mean.

This method directly uses the bootstrapped means without needing to estimate the standard error.\n",

    "#Bootstrapping just means repeat the same experiment many times, maybe m = 10000 times. This would be very costly in real life, so maybe we simulate repeating the experiment using the computer. The good side, is by repeating the same experiment many times, we can see how each experimental result is similar or different, and use them to find, for example, confidence intervals of parameters. In this example of average, we have only 1 sample size n from that population. We can get 1 sample mean from this sample. This would only be 1 experiment out of 10000 experiments that we want to run. But, we can not go and repeat this experiment 9999 times more, in real life. So, to try to simulate repeating this same experiment 9999 times, we can assume (or pretend) that the population itself is the n samples that I have, and sample n data from this new population, 9999 times, using the computer. Since I only have n data in this population, and I want to sample n times, I must sample with replacement. Then I would get 9999 simulated expriements, each with a sample mean, for a total of 10000 samples means. Then I can construct a 95% confidence interval by removing the lowest 2.5% and the highest 2.5% of sample means. Lastly, I can ask whether my hypothesized guess lie in this confidence interval. If so, then I would have some confidence that my guess is plausible.\n",
